<overview>
After a decade of effort to recover following the distastrous outcome of the Fourth Succession War, the Capellan Confederation finally started fielding upgraded infantry armor in the late 3040s.  Continuing the existing focus on basic but sturdy and reliable material the armor eventually included minor changes in appearance in line with the new Chancellor's Xin Sheng program.
