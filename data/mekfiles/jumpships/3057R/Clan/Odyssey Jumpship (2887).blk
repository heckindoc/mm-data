<capabilities>
The vessel is equipped with four DropShip hardpoints and a lithium-fusion battery system, allowing for rapid consecutive jumps. It also features two grav decks located within its 110-meter-wide command section to maintain crew health. True to Clan doctrine, the ship is well-defended. Its arsenal is dominated by ER and Pulse lasers, supplemented by two nose-mounted Gauss rifles to deter frontal assaults. Four anti-missile guns provide point defense. The ship carries two Points of Elementals specifically trained for zero-G operations. While battle armor is too large for the ship’s narrow maintenance access ways, these marines provide a formidable defense within the larger decks of the command section.

<overview>
The Odyssey-class is a large, stocky JumpShip utilized by several Clans, most notably excluding the Wolf and Jade Falcon Clans. Measuring just under three-quarters of a kilometer in length, the vessel is distinctive for its thick profile, resembling a scaled-up Scout-class ship rather than its leaner relatives like the Monolith. Its design emphasizes survivability and security, featuring a massive command section that serves as the ship's primary habitation hub.
</overview>

<history>
While widely distributed among various Clan fleets, the Odyssey has earned a reputation for being nearly impossible to capture. Its internal design reflects a philosophy of extreme compartmentalization; the ship's engineering sections are accessible only through narrow passageways sealed by reinforced bulkheads every 20 meters. This layout, combined with the ability for the bridge crew to remotely control life support and door locks for every segment of the ship, has ensured that to date, no Odyssey has ever been successfully boarded and seized by hostile forces.
