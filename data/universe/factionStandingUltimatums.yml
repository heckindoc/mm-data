    # Represents the date commemorating the schism within ComStar. Primus Myndo Waterly was killed June 6th 3025, a
    # week later (June 13th) Sharilar Mori was elected as Primus. This caused Precentor Demona Aziz to head to Atreus
    # (FWL) and kick off the ComStar Schism. It's a 100-day journey from Terra to Atreus, which is how we got this
    # date. There is an argument to be made that Precentor Aziz probably could have traveled via command circuit or
    # similar. I think that's very valid, however, I still went with the below date as it factors time needed to get
    # a meeting with Thomas Marik and then to arrange the HPG message that officially starts the schism.
