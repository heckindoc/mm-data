description: <p>“The most complete equipment reference book published to date.” – New Avalon Herald, July 15, 3025. This Technical Readout lists the capabilities and history of the most common pieces of military hardware used by the major houses of the Successor States in the year 3025. Focusing on BattleMechs and Aerospace Fighters, this volume also discusses important combat and support vehicles as well as the rare Land-Air-Mechs. In all, 55 ’Mechs, 15 fighters, 3 LAMs, 4 DropShips, and 12 Vehicles are described and illustrated, making this volume a must for all, from historians to MechWarriors. This seminal Technical Readout has not seen print in nearly three decades, and is reproduced here with updated artwork in addition to new in-universe commentary and updates, and retrospective by the original artist, Duane Loose.</p>
